A modern, zero-dependency cache for JavaScript and TypeScript with a **pluggable
eviction policy**. Its headline policy is **W-TinyLFU**: a frequency-based
admission filter in front of a Segmented LRU, which keeps the *hot set* resident
and beats plain LRU on skewed (Zipfian) and bursty workloads without giving up
recency.

This is not "another LRU". [`lru-cache`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru-cache)
already owns the LRU default and does it well. The wedge here is the eviction
*quality* niche that JavaScript lost when its only real W-TinyLFU port
(`transitory`) went unmaintained: a measurably higher hit ratio on real traces,
with the policy swappable so you can run your own bake-off. This is my take on
that gap, not the one true cache.

## What this is

If none of the words above meant anything, start here.

A **cache** is a small box you keep answers in so you do not have to compute or
fetch them twice. It is small on purpose, because the whole point is that it
costs less than the thing it is standing in front of. So the box fills up, and
every time something new arrives you have to throw something out.

**Which thing you throw out is the entire game.** That decision is called the
**eviction policy**, and it decides your hit ratio: the fraction of requests the
box can answer without going to the database, the network or the CPU behind it.
A cache with a good policy and a cache with a bad one can be the same size and
differ by a factor of two in how often they help you.

The default policy nearly everywhere is **LRU**: throw out whatever was used
least recently. It is simple, it is fast, and it has one well-known weakness.
Sweep a few thousand items through it that nobody will ever ask for again, a
report job, a crawler, a backup, and LRU dutifully evicts your genuinely hot
data to make room for garbage it will never be asked for. That is called **scan
pollution**, and it is the reason your cache hit ratio falls off a cliff at 3am
for no reason anybody can find.

The fix, known for years and standard on the JVM, is to stop admitting things
just because they are new. Keep a compact record of **how often** keys are
requested, and when a newcomer wants in, only let it displace an incumbent if it
is actually more popular. That is **W-TinyLFU**, and this package is a
JavaScript implementation of it, with the policy swappable so you can put LRU,
LFU or your own back in and measure the difference yourself.

So: this is a cache, in the class of **eviction-policy libraries**, competing on
hit ratio rather than on ergonomics or speed.

> ### Status: early release (0.6.x)
> The **`Cache`** is here with a real, scan-resistant **W-TinyLFU** by default,
> optional per-entry **TTL**, a **pluggable eviction policy** (`WTinyLFU`, `LRU`,
> `LFU`, or your own), and **`memo`** for caching sync or async functions with
> in-flight de-duplication. A reproducible hit-ratio bake-off backs the claims.
> The core is feature-complete; the version is `0.x` while the API settles toward
> 1.0. See the [roadmap](#roadmap).

## Install

```sh
npm install koffein
```

Ships ESM and CommonJS builds with type declarations. Node >= 18. Zero runtime
dependencies.

## Quick start

```ts
import { Cache } from "koffein";

const cache = new Cache<string, User>(10_000); // hold up to 10k entries

cache.set("user:42", user);
cache.get("user:42"); //  => user
cache.get("user:999"); // => undefined (a miss)

cache.has("user:42"); //  => true
cache.peek("user:42"); // read without counting it as a use
cache.delete("user:42");
cache.stats(); // { size, capacity, hits, misses, evictions, hitRatio }
```

Keys can be any type as *storage*: membership is `Map` identity, so any value
works as a key. **Admission control is not indifferent to the key's shape,
though.** The default policy feeds every key to a frequency sketch, and its
built-in hash only distinguishes **strings and integers**. Every other shape goes
through `String(key)`, so all plain objects collapse onto the single counter
`"[object Object]"`: the sketch can no longer tell a hot key from a one-hit scan,
ties are decided by the admission coin flip, and the scan resistance this cache
exists for quietly stops working. If your keys are objects, hash their content:

```ts
import { Cache, WTinyLFU } from "koffein";

type Key = { tenant: string; id: number };

const cache = new Cache<Key, Row>(10_000, {
  policy: new WTinyLFU<Key, Row>({ hash: (k) => fnv1a(`${k.tenant}:${k.id}`) }),
});
```

`fnv1a` is four lines and is spelled out under
[Hashing string keys](#hashing-string-keys); see
[Choosing a policy](#choosing-a-policy) for the rest of the policy options.

### Expiry (TTL)

Give entries a time-to-live, cache-wide or per entry. Expiry is lazy: an expired
entry reads as a miss and frees its slot on the next touch, so there are no
timers to manage.

```ts
const sessions = new Cache<string, Session>(10_000, { ttl: 60_000 }); // 60s default
sessions.set("sid:abc", session); //           expires 60s after this write
sessions.set("sid:xyz", session, 5 * 60_000); // this one lives 5 minutes
```

### Why it holds up under scans

The cache records every access in a frequency sketch, and when it is full it
admits a newcomer into the main region only if the sketch says that newcomer has
been seen at least as often as the entry it would replace. A key touched once (a
scan, a crawler, a one-off report) cannot evict a proven-hot entry, which is
exactly where a plain LRU bleeds hit ratio.


## Why W-TinyLFU

- **LRU leaves hit ratio on the table.** On skewed access it evicts a hot key
  the moment a burst of one-hit-wonders scans through (the classic "scan
  pollution"). Pure LFU fixes that but never forgets, so a key that was hot
  yesterday lingers forever.
- **W-TinyLFU** keeps a small **window** (an LRU that catches recency and bursts)
  in front of a **Segmented LRU main**, and only *admits* a candidate into the
  main cache when a compact **frequency sketch** says it is hotter than the
  victim it would replace. The sketch **ages** periodically, so admission stays
  recency-aware instead of frozen in the past. This is the design behind
  [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine), the reference JVM cache.

## Benchmarks

koffein is measured against plain LRU, the popular npm caches, and the modern
research policies (SIEVE, S3-FIFO, LFU) with an independent harness,
[cache-arena](https://github.com/destbreso/cache-arena), on the same seeded
workloads and through the same uniform driver. Caches are compared at equal
**peak occupancy in entries**, measured rather than declared: the harness drives
each cache through its own surface until the resident set stops growing, then
sizes it so that measured peak matches the budget, which is how a cache that
really holds 2x its nominal capacity gets sized down to match. None of that is a
claim about **bytes**: the harness has no byte instrument, and per-entry overhead
differs between libraries. Full tables, every workload, and the methodology live
in [BENCHMARKS.md](./BENCHMARKS.md), which `npm run bench:arena` regenerates from
scratch and which records the harness version and the Node version it ran on. The
short version:

**Hit ratio (efficiency).** On skewed (Zipfian) traffic, the common case, koffein
returns markedly more hits than plain LRU at the same size, and the gap is widest
exactly where a cache hurts most: when it is small relative to the working set.

| Zipf 0.99, cache size | koffein (W-TinyLFU) | plain LRU | vs LRU |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0.1% of footprint | 28.1% | 15.3% | +84% |
| 1% of footprint | 49.8% | 39.6% | +26% |
| 10% of footprint | 71.7% | 66.3% | +8% |

Read that table with its own limits attached. The +84% is against plain LRU, the
default nearly everywhere but not the strongest policy in the panel, at the most
extreme size; at 10% of footprint the same comparison is +8%. And against the
strong policies koffein does not lead: at the exact column headlined above it
sits inside the top group but not at the front of it, behind S3-FIFO at 30.0%,
SIEVE at 28.6% and LFU at 28.3%. What the table says is that a good modern policy
is worth a great deal over LRU and that this is a good modern policy, which is
the honest and still useful claim.

`transitory`, the other npm W-TinyLFU, reads 27.2% in the same column, and that
0.9 of a point is worth explaining rather than banking. The harness measures peak
occupancy instead of trusting it, and `transitory` holds 1.36 entries per entry
of nominal capacity at that size where koffein holds 1.00, so it is sized down to
compare at equal occupancy. Treat the two as level. What matters here is not the
ordering, it is the cross-check: two independent W-TinyLFU implementations
landing in the same region is the evidence that this one is built right.

On a pure **loop** larger than the cache, LRU's textbook worst case, the
W-TinyLFU family is the only one that recovers a meaningful share: koffein reads
0.0% at every size below 25% of footprint and 20.8% at 25%, where the nearest
non-family result is Random at 2.0%.

![koffein vs the field on YCSB-skew Zipf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/destbreso/koffein/main/charts/mrc-zipf-0-99.svg)

Efficiency numbers above are exact (a deterministic simulation). Throughput is
not, so it is measured differently: [BENCHMARKS.md](./BENCHMARKS.md) reports the
median of 12 interleaved trials in each of five separate processes, prints the
spread within a run and the spread between runs as two figures, and ranks two
caches only when all five processes agreed on which was faster. Pairs they split
are listed as unordered.

## Where this earns its place

The shape to look for is always the same: **the box is small relative to what it
is standing in front of, and the traffic is uneven.** Uneven traffic is the
normal case, because real popularity is skewed: a few keys carry most of the
requests. If both halves are true, the eviction policy is doing real work and it
is worth caring which one you have.

**A read-through cache in front of a database or an API.** The classic case. Some
rows are requested constantly and most are requested once, so admission control
is the difference between serving the hot set from memory and paying for it every
time. The bigger the gap between your cache size and your working set, the more
the policy matters: at 0.1% of the footprint the table above shows 28.1% against
15.3%, which is most of your database load.

**Anything sharing a process with a batch job, a crawler or a report.** This is
scan pollution and it is the case W-TinyLFU exists for. A sweep of keys nobody
will request again cannot evict your hot set here, because a newcomer has to
prove it is more popular than the thing it would displace. On a pure loop larger
than the cache, LRU's textbook worst case, this is the only family in the
benchmark that recovers a meaningful share of the hits, and only once the cache
reaches a quarter of the footprint: below that everything in the panel, koffein
included, reads zero.

**Memoizing an expensive pure function.** `memo` wraps a sync or async function
with in-flight de-duplication, so a hundred concurrent callers asking for the
same uncomputed key produce one computation, not a hundred. Rate-limited API
clients, template compilation, parsing, hashing, image transforms.

**Serverless and edge, where memory is the billed resource.** A higher hit ratio
at the same memory is directly a smaller instance or a smaller bill, and zero
dependencies means nothing to install at a cold start.

**When you actually want to run the bake-off.** The policy is a constructor
argument, and `LRU`, `LFU` and your own implementation all plug into the same
interface, so "is this better for my traffic" is a question you can answer on
your own trace instead of taking my word for it.

## Limits

What the cache does not do, stated here rather than discovered later.

- **Capacity is entries, not bytes.** `new Cache(10_000)` holds ten thousand
  entries whatever they weigh. There is no size function and no byte budget, so a
  cache of wildly uneven values is not memory-bounded in any useful sense.
- **Expiry frees a slot when the entry is touched, not when it expires.** Lazy TTL
  is why there are no timers to manage, and it is also why an expired entry keeps
  occupying its slot until something reads, overwrites or evicts it. A cache that
  has gone quiet stays full of dead entries.
- **No eviction callback.** There is no `onEvict` or `dispose` hook, so a value
  that owns a resource (a socket, a file handle) will not be closed for you.
- **No iteration.** No `keys()`, `values()` or `entries()`. The cache is a lookup
  structure, not a collection you walk; `size` and `stats()` are the whole
  introspection surface, and `stats()` counts from construction or the last
  `clear()`.
- **Frequency is an estimate that saturates at 15.** The sketch never
  underestimates but can overestimate on a hash collision, and above 15 it cannot
  tell a warm key from a scorching one. That is enough for admission, which only
  ever asks "hotter than the victim it would replace", and it is not a counter to
  read as truth.
- **Object keys need a hash.** Worth repeating from the quick start, because it is
  the one way to install this cache and silently lose the property it exists for.
- **One process, one thread.** Nothing is shared across workers, nothing survives
  a restart, and there is no invalidation protocol.

## When not to use this

Both ends, because a package that only names one is advertising.

**Your working set fits comfortably in the cache.** If almost nothing ever gets
evicted, the eviction policy is answering a question that never comes up. You are
paying for a frequency sketch and an admission decision to arrange items you were
never going to throw out. Use a `Map`, or `lru-cache` for the ergonomics.

**Your traffic is uniform.** Admission control works by betting that popularity
is predictive. If every key really is equally likely, there is nothing to
predict, the sketch is overhead, and LRU's simplicity wins.

**Your working set turns over wholesale, and the cache is not small.** Frequency
is memory, and memory of a popularity distribution that no longer exists is a
cost. On the harness's `shift` workload, where the working set moves every phase,
koffein leads plain LRU while the cache is small (48.1% against 38.9% at 1% of
footprint) and then falls behind it as the cache grows: 69.3% against 76.5% at
10% of footprint, and 76.0% against 90.6% at 25%. If your traffic is phases
rather than a stable popularity distribution, and your cache is generous relative
to the footprint, plain LRU
([`lru-cache`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru-cache),
[`tiny-lru`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiny-lru)) is the better bet.

**Throughput is your bottleneck, not hit ratio.** Admission is not free: koffein
does more work per operation than a bare LRU map, a sketch lookup and sometimes
an eviction decision, so it is not the throughput leader. In the same report it
averages 9.9 million operations per second across the eight workloads, against
18.9 for [`tiny-lru`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiny-lru), 17.1 for
[`quick-lru`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quick-lru) and 13.2 for
[`lru-cache`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru-cache) on the same machine and in
the same rounds, and every one of those three gaps is one all five replicates
agreed on. If your backing store is fast and your cache is doing millions
of operations a second, one of those may serve you better even at a lower hit
ratio. That is a real trade and the numbers for both sides are in
[BENCHMARKS.md](./BENCHMARKS.md).

**You need a distributed or persistent cache.** This is an in-process, in-memory
cache. It does not replicate, it does not survive a restart, and it has no
opinion about invalidation across instances. Reach for Redis or Memcached.

What is left, and what this package is for: an in-process cache that is smaller
than its working set, on skewed or bursty traffic, where a hit ratio point is
worth more to you than a nanosecond.


## Choosing a policy

The cache delegates every eviction decision to a policy. The default is
`WTinyLFU`; swap it with one line, or bring your own.

```ts
import { Cache, WTinyLFU, LRU, LFU } from "koffein";

new Cache(cap); //                       W-TinyLFU (the default)
new Cache(cap, { policy: new LRU() }); // plain LRU
new Cache(cap, { policy: new LFU() }); // plain LFU (in-cache counts, no aging)
```

- **`WTinyLFU`** (default) is the scan-resistant, skew-friendly policy the rest
  of this README is about. It takes its own tuning via
  `new WTinyLFU({ hash, random })`: `hash` maps a key to a 32-bit integer for the
  frequency sketch (strings and integers are handled for you, **object keys need
  one** or they all share a single counter and admission degenerates), and
  `random` is the admission tie-break source (inject a seeded one for
  deterministic tests).
- **`LRU`** and **`LFU`** are honest, textbook baselines, offered so you can
  measure the gap on *your own* traffic instead of taking the bake-off's word for
  it. Install each behind the same `Cache` and compare `stats().hitRatio`.

Write your own by implementing `EvictionPolicy<K, V>`: `init(capacity)`,
`onAdd(node)` (returns a victim to evict or `null`), `onAccess(node)`,
`onMiss(key)`, `onRemove(node)`, and `clear()`. The `Node` and `EvictionPolicy`
types are exported for this. So is `IntrusiveList`, the doubly-linked list the
built-in policies are built on (`pushHead`, `moveToHead`, `popTail`, `remove`,
`clear`, plus `head`, `tail` and `size`): the node *is* the list cell, so moving
an entry between lists is O(1) and allocates nothing, and `Node` carries three
scratch fields (`segment`, `hash`, `freq`) your policy may use however it likes.
TTL is orthogonal and works behind any policy.

### Selecting a policy by name

A policy can also be chosen by a registered name, and you can register your own so
it is selectable exactly like a built-in:

```ts
import { Cache, registerPolicy, policyNames } from "koffein";

new Cache(cap, { policy: "lru" }); // built-in names: "w-tinylfu", "lru", "lfu"

registerPolicy("my-policy", () => new MyPolicy());
new Cache(cap, { policy: "my-policy" }); // your policy, selected by name

policyNames(); // => ["w-tinylfu", "lru", "lfu", "my-policy"]
```

The registry stores factories, so each cache gets a fresh instance, and an
unknown name throws. Instance and string forms coexist: pass an instance when you
need to configure it (`new WTinyLFU({ hash })`) or want full type checking, a name
when the default of a policy is all you want.

## Memoizing a function

`memo` wraps a function so its results are cached, with the whole W-TinyLFU (and
optional TTL) machine underneath. It is async-aware where it counts.

```ts
import { memo } from "koffein";

const getUser = memo(fetchUser, { capacity: 10_000, ttl: 60_000 });

await getUser(42); // runs fetchUser(42), caches the result
await getUser(42); // served from cache
```

For async functions it caches the **promise**, so two concurrent calls for the
same key share a single in-flight computation (the function runs once, not once
per caller). If that promise rejects, the entry is evicted, so a failure is never
cached and the next call retries.

Keys default to the first argument. For multi-argument functions, pass a `keyFn`:

```ts
const distance = memo(computeDistance, { keyFn: (from, to) => `${from}->${to}` });
```

`capacity` (default 1000), `ttl`, `clock`, and `policy` pass through to the
underlying cache. The memoized function also carries `.delete(...args)` to
invalidate one call, `.clear()`, `.stats()`, and `.cache` for direct access.

One behavior to know: `undefined` is the miss sentinel, so a call that returns
`undefined` is never served from cache and runs again every time. Return `null`
for "computed, and the answer is nothing".

## Cache API

### `new Cache<K, V>(capacity, options?)`
A cache holding up to `capacity` entries. Options: `policy?: EvictionPolicy`
selects the eviction strategy (default `new WTinyLFU()`; see
[Choosing a policy](#choosing-a-policy)); `ttl?: number` sets a default per-entry
lifetime in milliseconds (omit for no expiry); `clock?: () => number` overrides
the time source (defaults to `Date.now`, injectable for deterministic tests).
Throws `RangeError` if `capacity` is not a positive integer or `ttl` is not
positive. (Key hashing and the admission RNG are configured on `WTinyLFU`, not
here.)

### `cache.get(key)` / `cache.set(key, value, ttl?)`
Read (recording a use, which can promote the entry) and insert-or-update. A
per-call `ttl` (milliseconds) overrides the cache-wide default for that entry,
and every write refreshes the entry's expiry.

### `cache.peek(key)` / `cache.has(key)` / `cache.delete(key)` / `cache.clear()`
`peek` reads without recording a use; the others are the obvious operations.

### `cache.stats()` / `cache.size` / `cache.capacity`
`stats()` returns `{ size, capacity, hits, misses, evictions, hitRatio }`.

## The frequency sketch (also usable on its own)

`FrequencySketch` is a Count-Min Sketch with 4-bit saturating counters and
periodic aging: the frequency estimator behind TinyLFU admission, and the engine
the `Cache` uses internally. It is exported on its own for any "how hot is this
key, approximately and cheaply" question.

```ts
import { FrequencySketch } from "koffein";

const sketch = new FrequencySketch(1000); // tuned for ~1000 live entries

// The sketch works on a 32-bit numeric hash of your key. Any integer works:
// it runs a murmur3 finalizer internally, so even low-entropy ids spread well.
sketch.increment(42);
sketch.increment(42);
sketch.increment(42);

sketch.frequency(42); // => 3   (an estimate; never below the true count)
sketch.frequency(7); //  => 0   (never seen)
```

### Hashing string keys

The sketch takes a number so it stays a pure primitive. For string keys, hash
them first (the `Cache` does this for you; here is a compact FNV-1a, the same one
it uses, for the sketch on its own):

```ts
function fnv1a(str: string): number {
  let h = 0x811c9dc5;
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    h ^= str.charCodeAt(i);
    h = Math.imul(h, 0x01000193);
  }
  return h >>> 0;
}

sketch.increment(fnv1a("user:1042"));
sketch.frequency(fnv1a("user:1042")); // => 1
```

### Aging

Aging is automatic: once the sketch observes `10 x capacity` increments, every
counter is halved, so recent activity outweighs the distant past. You can also
trigger it manually to decay the whole sketch on demand:

```ts
const s = new FrequencySketch(500);
for (let i = 0; i < 15; i++) s.increment(99); // saturates at 15
s.reset();
s.frequency(99); // => 7   (15 >> 1)
```

## API

### `new FrequencySketch(capacity: number)`
Creates a sketch tuned for roughly `capacity` live entries. Internally sizes to
the next power of two and 4 hash rows. Throws `RangeError` if `capacity` is not a
positive integer.

### `sketch.increment(hash: number): void`
Records one occurrence of `hash`. Increments 4 counters (one per row, all
distinct) up to a ceiling of 15, and ages the sketch when the sample fills.

### `sketch.frequency(hash: number): number`
Returns the estimated count of `hash`, in `0..15`. The estimate is the **minimum**
across the 4 rows, so it can overestimate on a hash collision but **never
underestimates** the true count. That one-sided error is exactly what an
admission filter wants: better to admit a cold key than reject a hot one.

### `sketch.reset(): void`
Halves every counter (recency-biased aging). Called automatically at the sample
threshold; exposed for manual decay and inspection.

### `sketch.clear(): void`
Drops all state.

### `sketch.size` / `sketch.capacity` / `sketch.sampleSize` (readonly)
Diagnostics: increments observed since the last aging reset, the configured
capacity, and the increment count that triggers aging (`10 x capacity`).

## Design notes

- **One-sided error.** Count-Min never underestimates. A cache does not need the
  true frequency, only "is this key hotter than the victim it would evict", so a
  saturating 4-bit counter (0..15) is enough and keeps the whole sketch tiny:
  eight counters packed per 32-bit word.
- **Distinct rows.** The 4 rows use double hashing `g_i = h1 + i * h2` with an
  odd stride, so a key's 4 counters never collide with each other. Only *other*
  keys can inflate an estimate, and only upward.
- **Aging keeps it honest.** Halving on a schedule is what separates TinyLFU from
  a plain frequency counter: yesterday's hot key decays instead of dominating.

## Roadmap

- [x] `FrequencySketch` (Count-Min + 4-bit counters + aging) with correctness tests
- [x] `Window` (LRU ~1%) + `SLRU` main (probation / protected ~80%)
- [x] Admission gate: candidate-vs-victim frequency + randomized tie-break
- [x] `Cache`: `get / set / has / delete / peek / clear`, `.stats()`
- [x] TTL (cache-wide default + per-call override, injectable clock)
- [x] Hit-ratio bake-off (seeded Zipfian / scan / shifting traces vs LRU / LFU)
- [x] Pluggable `EvictionPolicy` interface (`WTinyLFU` / `LRU` / `LFU` / your own)
- [x] `memo` (sync/async, in-flight de-duplication, a rejected result not cached)
- [x] Extensible string-name policy selector (`{ policy: 'lru' }`, `registerPolicy`)

Out of scope for v1: ARC and S3-FIFO (behind the policy interface later),
adaptive window resizing, and any distributed or multi-backend store (that is
[`keyv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv)'s job; koffein stays in-memory).
